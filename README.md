## About my decisions

I've chosen Vue.js since it's the JavaScript framework that I'm most comfortable with currently.

I created the project using Vue-CLI. For state management, I'm using Vuex and for routing, the Vue-Router.

About CSS, I was going to use an utility framework called Tailwind and I configured it, but then I decided to write all the CSS from the scratch using the preprocessor Stylus.

For charts, I've used Chart.js and all the other UI Components, I've coded from scratch.

I'm following the Vue.js official style guide: https://vuejs.org/v2/style-guide/.

I wish I could have more time to work on this. I left unit tests for the last minute, but I ran out of time.
