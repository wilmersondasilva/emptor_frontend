## About my decisions

I've chosen Vue.js since it's the JavaScript framework that I'm more comfortable with currently.

I created the project using Vue-CLI. For state management, I'm using Vuex and for routing, the Vue-Router.

About CSS, I was going to use a utility framework called Tailwind and I configured it, but then I decided to write all the CSS from the scratch using the preprocessor Stylus.

I'm following the Vue.js official style guide: https://vuejs.org/v2/style-guide/.

I wish I could have more time to work on this. I left unit tests for the last moment, but I ran out of time.
